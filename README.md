# VigenereCipher
by Ayush Singh 

# Overview
A simple polyalphabetic substitution technique is used in the VigenÃ¨re Cipher to encrypt alphabetic text. It employs a series of shifts depending on a keyword to expand the Caesar cipher. This seemingly straightforward approach baffled cryptographers for generations because of its seeming depth and complexity.

# HOW IT WORKS
1. Encryption:Â involves moving each letter to a certain number of positions. A recurring keyword tells us how many locations to move.
2. Decryption: The opposite of encryption is decryption. Using the same phrase, move the letters back to where they were before.
